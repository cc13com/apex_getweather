Dynamic APEX plugin to get weather data

Use this Plugin to fetch weather data from https://openweathermap.org/ and show this in APEX page items.

At the moment the selected location will be localized by geographic coordinates (lat, lon). The results are the temperature, conditions and weather icon.
